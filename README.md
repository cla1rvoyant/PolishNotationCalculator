Enter an expression in the form `operator operand operand`, for example `+ 3 4`.
If you want to enter an expression with two or more operations, then write priority operations in the depth of the expression (the higher the priority, the deeper the operation), for example `+ 2 * 2 2` or `+ * 2 2 2`. In both cases the answer will be 6.
